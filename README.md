# Matrix Operations with Process Forking

This C code, developed on Ubuntu as part of a university activity, performs matrix operations and demonstrates process forking in a Unix/Linux environment.
<br><br>
It initializes a matrix, prints its transposition, and creates a child process to download a webpage and count occurrences of a specific word.<br> 
The parent process waits for the child to finish and prints a message based on the child's termination status.
